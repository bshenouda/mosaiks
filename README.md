This repository illustrates how to process label data for merging with MOSAIKS features obtained from the [MOSAIKS API](siml.berkeley.edu).

Each folder provides an example of label preparation, starting from different formats: polygon, vector, and point data. Each example uses different data from different sources to provide an understanding of the types of data formats and labels that can be used to make predictions.

Further resources can be found at siml.berkeley.edu.
